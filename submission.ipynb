    "## Introduction            \n",
    "According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the word underrated is defined as \"Rated or valued too low.\" On the other hand, Merriam-Webster defines the term to be describing something that is \"Not recognized for its true worth; undervalued.\" These definitions, when analyzed in the context of movies, could be interpreted to mean two different things: while the OED definition could be interpreted to describe a movie that is rated lower than it deserves, Merriam-Webster's definition could be taken to refer to movies that are simply not recognised to be good by a large enough group of people. For this project, we took Merriam-Webster's definition and used tools in data analytics to create the ultimate list of underrated movies across genres, regions, and decades. Our main challenege was to determine what it means for a movie to have low enough votes and high enough ratings to be 'underrated', and so our first step for this project was to use some basic statistical tools to determine a 'good' rating and a 'low' number of votes.

To do this, we first looked at the median number of votes (so the result would not be skewed by movies like Shawshank Redemption!) and median number of ratings across movies in the IMDB dataset."
